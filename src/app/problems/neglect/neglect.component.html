<p class="para">Turtles are environmentally sensitive animals, and their proper care requires the experience necessary to properly mimic their natural habitats. They need a carefully curated diet, a certain temperature and humidity range, appropriate substrate, a large amount of space, and special lighting that mimics the spectral range of sunlight and allows them to absorb and synthesize Vitamin D. </p>

<p class="para">Unfortunately, many organizers of and participants in turtle races have little to no knowledge of turtle husbandry. They often capture wild turtles weeks or months in advance of the race. Frequently, these turtles are kept in cramped and inappropriate conditions not even close to fulfilling their biological needs. Turtles are often brought to races in five-gallon buckets or in plastic tubs, usually without appropriate substrate. The turtles frequently defecate in these enclosures and their shells become covered in each otherâ€™s feces. Numerous turtles are often kept together in inappropriately small enclosures.</p>

<p class="para">While neglect is unintended and can be fixed with education, some race participants unfortunately cross the line of Animal Abuse - where the harm is intentional or careless.</p>

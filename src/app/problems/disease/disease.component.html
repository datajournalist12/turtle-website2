<p class="para">It is extremely common for people to paint turtles prior to the race. This not only destroys their natural camouflage making them vulnerable to predators, and exposes them to any toxins in the paint, it cuts off their ability to synthesize Vitamin D through their shell which can lead to metabolic bone disease and other health issues. Shell rot can also occur because of poor nutrition, overly wet conditions, and inappropriate temperatures, and is frequently observed in turtles from turtle races. </p>

<p class="para">With large numbers of stressed animals held together in concentrations that would never happen naturally, the possibility of diseases spreading back to wild populations – and the development of novel diseases – is a dangerous possibility. It is quite common for children to accidentally drop turtles onto hard concrete at the race site, potentially causing internal injuries. We have seen plenty of turtles at turtle races with severe shell rot or other injuries that needed treatment. </p>

<p class="para">To highlight the situation at just one race, consider the turtle race in Missouri, where a turtle was observed with an area of necrotized flesh with a botfly infestation. At the same event, a female turtle started dropping eggs during the middle of the race. A locally rare Ornate Box Turtle was found with severe shell rot. Participants stated they had kept the turtle, which later died in the care of a wildlife rehabber, in a cattle trough for some time prior to the race.
